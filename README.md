lecture notes for advanced investment with python

This is the Python version of my Advance Investment Class. It consists of lecture notes and workshop notes (WS). If you are not familiar with Python, you should start with FINM8006WS2_Python.ipynb, which gives a clash course about Python and Pandas. Suggestions are welcomed, and usual copy rights apply.
